UCjVeEIWvwobo0Ie5FRHO7YQ,@dennistupper8262,2024-01-17T19:09:09Z,So listen to what you said.. They meaning the FED Will let the system end.. REALLY Will they ? Come on now... The Stupid Fed has well over 9 trillion on their so called Books... So they have to bail themselves out .. Either way More and More printing will continue and even if more banks go under the Feds still have to be on the hook for all FDIC Insured funds . So pretty much everyone who has $ 250k or less will be covered by the Fed means even more printing.. If you are married then $500 k and additional $250k for every kid... Bottom line is When Banks fail the Fed is still on the hook for TRILLIONS...

This video keeps you confused. The courts are the true banks and the police follow Codes = Uniform Commercial Codes = Uniformed Police following Post Codes = The Universal Postal Union in Bern Switzerland = Swiss Banking Merchants = Banking Cartels that Sell Your Birth Certificate because your Mum Registered You as an Infant + War = Infantry = Military Industrial Complex owned by the Banking Families = Royal Gold Hoarders. Remember: Switzerland Never Went To War = Hiding Gold = Social Security Account worth Billions $$ = Our Stolen Wealth = Commoners Wealth.

The Treasury have to sell Bonds to cover the trade imbalance and the government spending imbalance. In order to sell them they have to raise interest rates and the old long-term, low risk, low interest, AAA investments (including Treasury Bonds), held by the banks (often due to government regulatory policy), become next to worthless. The next milestone is the 15th when the government issue a new batch of Bonds. I have approximately 350k stagnant in my portfolio that needs growth. What is the best way to take advantage of this downturn?"

UCtfsQZZzyX9kSq94337lRgg,@GoldenAuraLife,2023-03-29T03:51:13Z,Why do most channels sugar coat it? We were taken off the gold standard in 1971 because years prior countires started to notice how the US was suddenly getting &quot;richer&quot; by recklessly printing money. These countries knew the US didnt have as much gold to back the money anymore.  They started asking for their gold back and the US knew it couldnt give it all at once to every country which it was holding so thats why Nixon took US off the gold standard. Once we start being honest about how we have treated the world with our dominance yet irresponsible behavior of money we could build better relationships. Maybe fix our system here we would have such a divide of the rich and poor. We are in debt because of the US being in denial about its actions for the last 100 years. Oh and printing &quot;money&quot; out of thin air over and over again.

Be patient. So you see someone making a million dollars in a week and you think: ‚Äúwhy am I not able to do the same?‚Äù. Don‚Äôt worry, chances are that that guy also didn‚Äôt make that money by trading, but by selling a dream to people. I‚Äôve been there. I lost ‚Ç¨4000 in two months, when I first started trading. I was 17, it was a devastating experience and I lost my appetite for days. After that experience, most of my decisions in life were driven by my strong desire to turn that bad experience around and become a profitable trader. I went to University to study Statistics for the Financial Markets, I started to work part time in order to put some money in my trading account, I took private lessons from a licensed financial trader. I developed a few proprietary trading strategies, specialised in risk management, building software to optimise it for each one of my trading strategies. I learnt about the importance of keeping your emotions out of your trading business. You can learn from your experience and become a better trader, or maybe you learnt that trading is not your type of business. That‚Äôs absolutely fine. There are many other types of businesses out there that can give you plenty of satisfaction and enrich your life. I‚Äôve never lived a better life than I do now as a trader. People like to think in percentages way too much. Let me explain; People look at the percentage of what a so-called pro-trader does, not realising that the market isn‚Äôt infinite and the size of your trade has a significant impact on how you can carry a trade out. I‚Äôm flexible enough to trade with high precision very close to how the market moves. Now, don‚Äôt underestimate a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position. I‚Äôm much bigger than your average trader @ home is. I frequently earn in a day what other people with so-called jobs earn in a year. Yet, for the FX market, I‚Äôm a big fish. ‚ÄúBig fish‚Äù that is making a couple thousand USD per pip. There is one last thing to say: The vast majority of people out there don‚Äôt have a clue how to trade and earn money. Today, I‚Äôm a full time trader, Financial Investment Advisor with 21years of experience. Expert in financial planning, analysis, and educating clients. Managed multi-million dollar portfolios, built strong relationships with clients, and helped them drive profitable growth.

Margins are getting tighter for the industry which is a concern for 2024. It‚Äôs a shame you need to act like the sky is falling by looking at one single metric for the banking industry.  If you want to point out a concern look at the AOCI for most banks in the country. This is the unrealized loss in their investment portfolios.  Bank of America‚Äôs AOCI is truly massive.

The rise in interest rates have caught many financial institutions by surprise after a couple decades of near zero interest rates so higher interest rates are likely the first time this has been experienced in the career of most financiers and financial analysts. But the disappearance of profits and even losses should be temporary, well managed banks and other financial institutions should adjust and gradually a new state of equilibrium will be reached for financial instruments.<br><br>As for customers, this is likely the intended effect the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve. The Fed is tasked with fighting inflation and a big part of this is to discourage the American Consumer from being so willing to pay ever higher spiraling prices for goods and services, and for businesses to be so willing to borrow to support making that last incremental widget that can still be made profitably.<br><br>This is all natural, including any banking losses, likely due to financial practices that were based on expectations of a stable economy with lower interest rates."

The reason is that banks create currency when they originate loans and when the loans are repaid the currency is destroyed.  What isnleft is the interest payments which wind their way into the economy as growth;  ergo there is no growth without credit. That is a very powerful priviledge.

This largely is the shift of rates on credit that impact start up industries and local landlords. Many can no longer get credit or it was cut in half. This hurts banks because the prior rates were flex. This leads to defaults and reduced new lending. It also means start ups use contractors more to cut costs.

They can play games with economic factors used to adjust the loss factors within any segment of the loan portfolio, overestimate the net realizable value of collateral (for large, &quot;non homogeneous&quot; loans), and/or over fund the Allowance for Loan Losses in good times and take advantage of over funding to &quot;smooth out&quot; the losses during lean times.

Half of that volume was delivered and paid for. Since the Biden administration the relation with China has deteriorated, and also because the Chinese market is not fond of genetically modified corn, Xi cancelled the contract. Corn is now coming form Brazil and South Africa (BRICS-countries).<br>Those contracts are no longer in US$. So, the US is losing a lot of money on that. Moreover, the Midwest farmers (Trump voters) have no alternative customers and have no income.<br>Banks in the Midwest are confronted with non-paying farmers. The FED already sold assets to support these banks. If it is not enough, some banks may no longer exist.<br>That could in a worst case scenario have effects on larger (inter-)national banks. <br>The conflict between Israel and Hamas may lead to a situation inwhich countries in the Middle East are forced to express their point of view and take a side. It is to be seen to what they decide.<br>China has cancelled contracts with other countries too, such as $100 billion for the delivery of cars from Germany. The Chinese economy is not running that well is one of the reasons.<br>If taxpayers have to save banks, there will be probably consequences for the war in Ukraine."

Therefore it‚Äôs like there under a completely different system where the interest rates don‚Äôt touch them. The difference from there loss to the Feds 100% is printed but not added to the FED balance sheet. So it looks like there tight but really loose. Back door bale out. Meanwhile the rest of us suffer with higher rates as the poor get poorer and the rich print more.

To prevent a severe economic downturn, it is necessary to implement a freeze on interest rates. Simultaneously, the White House should support the industry in boosting gas and oil production to lower fuel prices. The anti-oil stance only contributes to higher energy costs, leading to inflation throughout the economy. By reducing interest rates, tightening the money supply, cutting government expenditures, and increasing the availability of affordable fuel, inflation will decrease, and the economy will thrive. Unfortunately, various conflicting agendas make it unlikely for all these measures to be implemented, resulting in a recession and persistent inflation."

Hence, banks&#39; risk management desks were not prioritizing too many action plans about IRR interest rate risk management as the policy rate/s were kept on hold! <br>Now, once you have the risk in the policy rate, that led to multiple market and liquidity risks,  which created a classic ALRM Asset Liability Risk Management Event!<br>SVB and other banks are prime examples of Risk Management Desk failure and for once we can blame the treasury or other departments of these banks.<br>Most noticeable was that SVB was operating w/o a CRO Chief Risk Officer for many months, which goes on to show that financial institutions are scared of bolstering internal controls and the three risk lines of defence beyond certain protocol levels? <br>CS Debacle was also an archetypical financial risk management failure! <br>We can write an entire book on Governance, Compliance and Auditing book of malpractices in light of how Switzerland&#39;s top bank and how its Risk Department and silos failed to anticipate emerging risks and/or reduce financial losses when they materialised. <br>I think banks need to go beyond basic Basel Accords and develop forward-looking ERM programs and model frameworks so that all lines of defence can work in coordination during a crisis. <br>Of course, Crisis management and Risk Management are not the same disciplines! <br>Add Complexity Management to it, and it becomes a totally new area of study in Financial Studies and Systemic Risk Regulation."

Companies like FirstKey, Progress and others similar.  They sit these homes vacant because they are focused on the CAP rate to rent it.  These homes are VERY loosely managed, so they are ripe for scammers to rent them &quot;with no credit check&quot;, 1k dollars down, then they get rently box access, and produce a fake lease.  <br>Given the fact the law/police arent duty bound to decide if the lease is real or not, this moves to the courts.  The court has no idea either because these corporations run their portfolio very scatterbrained.  In Las Vegas, I know of a company that owns 1450+ homes and has 4 people in town managing these properties.  They have a myriad of unrented homes.  Many get vandalized over and over, as they rehab it, it gets destroyed, they rehab it again, it gets destroyed etc but versus lowering the rent 400 bucks and putting a renter in, it doesnt meet the spreadsheet requirement for rental cost vs acquisition, so it sits.  Irony again, is this companies headquarters is in ATL.  <br><br>Regulators allowed these whales to come in and buy up real estate, which pushes families out of the market and falsely inflates home values/depletes inventory.

I doubt that retirees in their 70s are buying up all the real estate right now. If anything, they&#39;re trying to pull together enough resources to pay for the very-expensive assisted-living homes they&#39;ll have to live in someday, which cost more $$ per month than they probably earned before they retired. Look towards a couple of Gen Xers -- Jeff Bezos, who owns almost everything, and Elon Musk, who owns everything else that Jeff Bezos doesn&#39;t own yet. Look to the millennial guys who started Airbnb and took over so much affordable housing around the world, or that WeWork guy who took over so much commercial office space. Look also at the private equity funds that continue to buy up housing, and investigate other bad actors. If everyone keeps blaming our problems solely on 75-year-old retirees, we&#39;ll never solve those problems...they&#39;re getting worse with each passing year, and they won&#39;t magically go away after everyone born before 1966 is long gone."

You yourself are calling out the banks, and in the end, the banks are just dollar producers. What is Bitcoin worth ? Who knows. But when money dies, you have to switch to something else, and Bitcoin is that something. Something that can be sent over the internet, something that cannot be inflated. Its just a good solution. Shiba Innu is none of the things Bitcoin is, you can&#39;t just see that they both have encryption and think they are the same. How many Shiba Innu can be created ? Who knows. Who holds all the supply ? Who knows. The reality is, you need trust for your money, and Bitcoin has worked in a trustless manner for over a decade, while protecting people&#39;s value, and someone else just whipped up this Shiba coin, and who knows how it works, but there is no reason to think that it will ever hold any value."

I still do not have access.  Yes, I have been to the bank and identified myself.  Yes, I have the names and emails concerning the two &quot;conceirge&quot; people in the bank who were supposed to either grant me on-line access or send me free cancelled checks.  Yes, twice, the same person has had to send me cancelled checks by email with another secret code.  I am waiting for the last check to clear, get a copy and bye bank.<br><br>The foregoing is not unusual.  It is a function of &quot;high tech&quot; and the reduction of &quot;customer service&quot;.  Following Dan&#39;s suggestion, I opened accounts at multiple credit unions and additional banks.  The slippage in bank customer service did not start in 2023.  About 20 years ago, Bank of America pioneered a new version of customer service.  You could no longer call directly to a branch.  You had to call a general number.  The customer service has further  changed to a new business model.  You call, get put on hold &quot;due to the high volume of calls&quot; (which is bad grammar copied by companies), finally, you leave a number and maybe you get a call back and maybe not.<br><br>Reduce the stress as Dan suggests:  1.  keep a pile of cash at home; 2. keep cash in the car; 3. keep a spare credit card in the car on a different account; 4. open multiple accounts at banks and credit unions; 5. keep a copy of each month&#39;s statement, preferably in writing."

That and considering that the super-wealthy control far more stocks and actual economy-influencing businesses than all these retail trading debt burdened folks . . . .    <br><br>The following is from BARD:   What is the approximate ratio of stocks controlled by the super-wealthy versus the retail traders?<br><br>&quot;Determining the exact ratio of stocks controlled by the super-wealthy versus retail traders is a complex task with no definitive answer. However, we can analyze several factors and estimates to get a general idea:<br><br>Concentration of Ownership:<br><br>Top 10%: Recent studies and data show that the top 10% of households in the US own around 89% of all publicly traded stocks. This means a very small group holds a vast majority of the wealth tied to the stock market.<br>Top 1%: Within the top 10%, the top 1% of households are estimated to hold an even larger share, potentially approaching 50% or more.<br>Retail Traders: The remaining 11% of stocks are held by the bottom 90% of households, which includes retail traders. This number has been declining in recent years, suggesting decreasing access to stock ownership for average individuals.&quot;     <br><br>So who is really controlling this economy?  Certainly NOT the retail traders.    I think that many analysts are not considering this, and we might find out later that the historic data may be actually hindering us some."

Here most loans and debts are linked to real estate ( own house) or for example a car or some household equipments like a washing machine or expensive Audio/TV set. In general taxes and social contributions are much higher than in the US but on return, health services are very cheap, same with access to college and higher education for students. If an economy drives on such large volumes of individual debts, you may create a time bomb like a ponzi system that could explode when the economy goes into recession for a longer period of time and people start to lose their jobs and income and can&#39;t pay back their debts anymore.  In Europe most people can&#39;t save no money anymore because most of  the average income is needed for overall housing + food + heating etc etc  Each system has pro and contra but the way it looks it makes the US economy very vulnerable to growth or recession with the result that not much drastic should happen or the avearge working man ends up in an trailor park ... and actually that is not a pretty sight for a wealthy society neither."

The people in power (not politicians) are controlling the world with the voting power your money buys them in mutual funds and ETFs.  They are not going to risk losing the power ESG gives them in a market crash.  They‚Äôll just print more (MMT) and steal your wealth thru monetary expansion.

The time for occurence of facing such a localized &quot;collapse&quot; if it was to ever happen, tend to be after the 3rd quarter annoucement of earning reports which favors the month of Oct as it did in 1929 when the market tend to be most fixated on the doom &amp; gloom sentiments after repeated disappointing results. But today is 2020s, as much as the rationale for how a textbook example of how a localized economy collapse can playout still applies today, that did not occur over the past century as the global market forces invisible at work here play a much larger role which was unaccounted for. &amp; the reason behind the US FEDs maintaining a high interest rates is not just simply to curb inflation as the localized rationale would perceive it to be, you just need to study the economic figures coming out from the 2nd largest economy China as well to see that there is now a real wrestling for powers &amp; global dominance between USA &amp; China to orientate &amp; influence the flow &amp; direction of investments from the leading global companies &amp; investors sentiments. Unlike the late 1920s, in the highly integrated global economies of 2020s, it is insufficient to analyse with localized data in US economy alone to narrate a collapse when there are many other significant economies apart from the US economy that are coming into the equation."

Also it used to be that when you got a rate increase only &quot;new&quot; borrowing was subject to that rate and your existing balance was paid back at the previous rate.  So now people are trapped with rates as high as 30%(or more!) and will never be able to retire their debt.  Unless you are diligent at paying your cards off each month and don&#39;t run up balances the future is indeed frightening!  It&#39;s easy to slip into this and I was fortunate to have the funds to just come to my senses and pay off my cards.  I feel bad for those who aren&#39;t that fortunate...:(

You will find it becoming increasingly difficult for your mind to comprehend what you‚Äôre reading:<br><br>Excerpts from Dr. Ivan Panin&#39;s 1899 Letter to the New York Sun<br><br>The first 17 verses of the New Testament contain the genealogy of the Christ. It consists of two main parts: Verses 1-11 cover the period from Abraham, the father of the chosen people, to the Captivity, when they ceased as an independent people. Verses 12-17 cover the period from the Captivity to the promised Deliverer, the Christ.<br><br>Let us examine the first part of this genealogy.<br><br>Its vocabulary has 49 words, or 7 x 7. This number is itself seven (Feature 1) sevens (Feature 2), and the sum of its factors is 2 sevens (Feature 3). Of these 49 words 28, or 4 sevens, begin with a vowel; and 21, or 3 sevens, begin with a consonant (Feature 4).<br><br>Again: these 49 words of the vocabulary have 266 letters, or 7 x 2 x 19; this number is itself 38 sevens (Feature 5), and the sum of its factors is 28, or 4 sevens (Feature 6, while the sum of its figures is 14, or 2 sevens (Feature 7). Of these 266 letters, moreover, 140, or 20 sevens, are vowels, and 126, or 18 sevens, are consonants (Feature 8).<br><br>That is to say: Just as the number of words in the vocabulary is a multiple of seven, so is the number of its letters a multiple of seven; just as the sum of the factors of the number of the words is a multiple of seven, so is the sum of the factors of the number of their letters a multiple of seven. And just as the number of words is divided between vowel words and consonant words by sevens, so is their number of letters divided between vowels and consonants by sevens.<br><br>Again: Of these 49 words 35, or 5 sevens, occur more than once in the passage; and 14, or 2 sevens, occur but once (Feature 9); seven occur in more than one form, and 42, or 6 sevens, occur in only one form (Feature 10). And among the parts of speech the 49 words are thus divided: 42, or 6 sevens, are nouns, seven are not nouns (Feature 12). Of the nouns 35 or 5 sevens, are Proper names, seven are common nouns (Feature 12). Of the Proper names 28 are male ancestors of the Christ, and seven are not (Feature 13).<br><br>Moreover, these 49 words are distributed alphabetically thus: Words under A-E are 21 in number, or 3 sevens; Z-K 14, or 2 sevens; M-X also 14. No other groups of sevens stopping at the end of a letter are made by these 49 words, the groups of sevens stop with these letters and no others. But the letters A, E, Z, K, M, X, are letters 1, 5, 6, 10, 12, 22, of the Greek alphabet, and the sum of these numbers (called their Place Values) is 56, or 8 sevens (Feature 14).<br><br>‚Ä¶<br>‚Ä¶ The New Testament is written in Greek. The Greeks had no separate symbols for expressing numbers, corresponding to our Arabic figures, but used instead the letters of their alphabet: just as the Hebrews, in whose language the Old Testament is written, made use for the same purpose of theirs. Accordingly, the 24 Greek letters stand for the following numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800. Every Greek word is thus a sum in arithmetic obtained by adding the numbers for which its letters stand, or their numeric values. Now the vocabulary to the entire genealogy has 72 words. If we write its numeric value over each of these 72 words, and add them, we get for their sum 42,364, or 6,052 sevens, distributed into the following alphabetical groups only: A-B, have 9,821, or 1,403 sevens: G-D, 1,904, or 272 sevens; 3,703, or 529 sevens; TH-R, 19,264, or 2,752 sevens; A-X 7,672, or 1,096 sevens. But the numeric value of the 10 letters used for making these groups is 931, or 7 x 7 x 19, a multiple not only of seven but of seven sevens.<br><br>‚Ä¶ The second part of this chapter, verses 18-25, relates the birth of the Christ. It consists of 161 words, or 23 sevens; occurring in 105 forms, or 15 sevens, with a vocabulary of 77 words or 11 sevens. Joseph is spoken to here by an angel. Accordingly, of the 77 words the angel uses 28 or 4 sevens; of the 105 forms he uses 35 or 5 sevens; the numeric value of the vocabulary is 52,605 or 7,515 sevens; of the forms, 65,429 or 9,347 sevens. This enumeration only begins as it were barely to scratch the surface of the numerics of this passage. But what is specially noteworthy here is the fact that the angel‚Äôs speech has also a scheme of sevens making it a kind of ring within a ring, a wheel within a wheel. If Mr. L. can write a similar passage of 161 words with the same scheme of sevens alone (though there are several others here) in some three years, he would have accomplished a still greater wonder. Let us assume that Matthew accomplished this feat in only 6 months.<br>3. The second chapter of Matthew tells of the childhood of the Christ. Its vocabulary has 161 words, or 23 sevens, with 896 letters, or 128 sevens, and 238 forms, or 34 sevens; the numeric value of the vocabulary is 123,529 or 17, 647 sevens; of the forms, 166,985 or 23, 885 sevens; and so on through pages of enumeration. This chapter has at least four logical divisions, and each division shows alone the same phenomena found in the chapter as a whole. Thus the first six verses have a vocabulary of 56 words, or 8 sevens, etc. There are some speeches here: Herod speaks, the Magi speak, the angel speaks. But so pronounced are numeric phenomena here, that though there are as it were numerous rings within rings, and wheels within wheels, each is perfect in itself through forming all the while only part of the rest‚Ä¶<br><br>4. There is not, however, a single paragraph of the scores in Matthew that is not constructed in exactly the same manner. Only with each additional paragraph the difficulty of constructing it increases not in arithmatical, but in geometrical progression. For he contrives to write his paragraphs so as to develop constantly fixed numeric relations to what goes before and after. Thus in his last chapter he contrives to use just 7 words not used by him before‚Ä¶ <br><br>Anyhow, Matthew did it, and we thus have a miracle ‚Äì an unheard-or literary, mathematical artist, unequaled, hardly even conceivable‚Ä¶<br>A second fact is yet more important: In his very first section, the genealogy discussed above, the words found nowhere else in the New Testament occur 42 times, 7 x 6; and have 126 letters, 7 x 6 x 3, each number a multiple not only of seven, but of 6 sevens, to name only two of the many numeric features of these words. But how did Matthew know, when designing this scheme for these words (whose sole characteristic is that they are found nowhere else in the New Testament) that they would not be found in the other 26 books? That they would not be used by the other 7 New Testament writers? Unless we assume the impossible hypothesis that he had an agreement with them to that effect, he must have had the rest of the New Testament before him when he wrote his book. The Gospel of Matthew, then, was written last.<br>5. It so happens, however, that the Gospel of Mark shows the very same phenomena. Thus the very passage called so triumphantly in today‚Äôs SUN a ‚Äòforgery,‚Äô the Last Twelve Verses of Mark, presents among some sixty features of sevens the following phenomena: It has 175 words, or 25 sevens, a vocabulary of 98 words, or 2 sevens of sevens, with 553 letters, or 79 sevens; 133 forms, or 19 sevens, and so on to the minutest detail. Mark then, is another miracle, another unparalled literary genius. And in the same way in which it was shown that Matthew wrote last it is also shown that Mark, too, wrote last. Thus to take an example from this very passage: It has just one word found nowhere else in the New Testament, theta, alpha, nu, alpha, sigma, iota, upsilon, omicron, sigma, deadly. This fact is signaled by no less than seven features of sevens, thus: its numeric value is 581 or 83 sevens, with the sum of its figures 14, or 2 sevens, of which the letters 3, 5, 7, 9 from the beginning of the word have 490, or 7 x 7 x 5 x 2: a multiple of seven sevens, with the sum of its factors 21, or 3 sevens. In the vocabulary it is preceded by 42 words: 7 x 6; in the passage itself by 126 words, or 7 x 6 x 3, both numbers multiples not only of seven, but of 6 sevens. We have thus established before us this third fact for Mr. L. to contemplate: Matthew surely wrote after Mark, and Mark just as surely wrote after Matthew.<br>6. It happens, however, to be a fourth fact that Luke presents the same phenomena as Matthew and Mark, and so does John, and James, and Peter, and Jude, and Paul. And we have thus no longer two great unheard-of mathematical literati, but eight of them and each wrote after the other.<br>7. And not only this: As Luke and Peter wrote each 2 books, John 5, and Paul 14, it can in the same way be shown that each of the 27 New Testament books was written last. In fact, not a page of the over 500 in Wescott and Hort‚Äôs Greek edition (which the writer has used throughout) but it can be demonstrated thus to have been written last.<br>The phenomena are there and there is no human way of explaining them. Eight men cannot each write last, 27 books, some 500 pages, cannot each be written last. But lets assume that one Mind directed the whole, and the problem is solved simply enough: by this Verbal Inspiration ‚Äì of every jot and tittle of the New Testament.<br>There remains only to be added that by precisely the same kind of evidence the Hebrew Old Testament is proved to be equally inspired. This the very first verse of Genesis has seven words, 28 letters, or 4 sevens: to name only two out of the dozens of numeric features of this one verse of only seven words."

I spent 18.5 years as a capital markets examiner for a federal financial institution regulator (with a capital markets emphasis), then 10.5 years as a financial analyst for the same agency. In addition to her sound observations, please note that the inflation adjusted GDP has already declined for two consecutive quarters- signalling recession. Federal Reserve rate increases, combined with quantitative tightening are the primary causes. As she notes, consumer spending is under pressure. Given approximately 70 percent of our economy is dependent upon consumer spending, further GDP erosion can be expected. Please also remember our government debt to GDP ratio is as high as it was immediately following WW II, but we don&#39;t have the growing economy, balanced budgets and favorable balance of trade that permitted us to pay down the debt back then. Another factor to consider is that one third of US government debt will reprice within 12 months at materially higher interest rates. Thus, the US is poorly positioned to provide the massive stimulus necessary to prevent recession."

The credit card debt has been increasing for sometime and it has now reached a record level ever. People cannot afford the high inflation anymore and the bubble is about to burst when banks start to collapse and companies laying off personnel causing recession. The usa has diminishing export of products as China reduces its imports on chips and agriculture products from the usa. A big shake out in the chips industries is coming as China now able to mass produce the high-end chips. The high usd exchange rate and the accelerating de-dollarization add more problems to the usa‚Äôs dire economic situation.The impending recession in the usa is likely to happen by next year followed by the demise of the usd. Brace yourself as it will be a massive tsunami which will come upon the usa.

It will be phased but then move swiftly.  Opposition is not showing serious teeth and demonstrating the publics objections.  Also, the younger generations have been left without education that developed their rationale.  Everything from education upwards has been monetised.  If we do not shout loudly now, we will soon own nothing and not be happy, despite Father Klaus of the World Economic Forum (WEF), assuring us with his ugly face that this will be how we will become.  All major main street banks in the USA have had rolling direct orders to all mortgage companies to automatically purchase these banks closures...all not evening going under the hammer anymore..."

UChQN9wGkb6XBtaOWkXPMyqw,@user-iz9zb6zh4f,2023-12-14T01:23:53Z,"The problem with the collapse of the economy is a cascading effect. One raises prices, another sees them make profit and thinks they will do the same. Then the process repeats like dominoes and everyone is raising prices thinking they will make more profit. And they do from the short sighted futuristic view. But eventually the effect has grown so large and to many raised prices that then everyone starts to suffer from it. Because then big business starts to lose profit because prices are to high and people cant afford them, with the reason being because prices on everything has risen as well, and then the people don&#39;t have enough money left after that for much. So this never works out to the benefit for the people or for business in the long run. The only way to stop this from happening is for everyone to try not to raise prices in the first place to prevent the cascading effect. Or to have laws put in place that state prices can only be raised to some set limit based on current affairs relating to wages earned and what is needed to survive for families at the current time. But I can see it coming as well if nothing is done about it. Far to many are following the thought that if they raise prices they make more profit. But that only has one eventual outcome, that everyone loses in the end."

This administration pushed companies into a box where the ACTUAL employment numbers would not be seen for upwards of 90-days.  For example, Yellow Freight, most of you know they filed bankruptcy and closed the doors but, the 24000 employees who were let go DID NOT show in the labor statistics due to the communist regimes plan to delay bad news.  Essentially, those laid off were given a 90-day extension on their salaries and Yellow Freight DOES NOT have to report their demise, no, they report they are STILL employed even after the doors were closed and there shall not be a proper report on this company for months.  There are hundreds of companies in the same position.  So the employment numbers show a good economy is pure BS.  Further, the recent 110,000 increase in employment was ALL government, not one private sector number, because the private sector is tanking.  There is so much more you folks are not being told and for those who voted for the POS PEDO biden are going to get a wakeup call of biblical proportions.

In general interest rates were too low for too long anyway, fueling increases of borrowing beyond reason. Others have opined that the politicians and fed ALWAYS opt for short term solutions to economic misery as they‚Äôre concerned with keeping their jobs above what medicine is truly needed in our economy. Since as far back as I can look, the Fed has alternated between printing shitloads of paper money and now, rising interest rates, and I‚Äôm sure when the shit gets nasty again they will print money yet again to bail‚Ä¶.things‚Ä¶. Out. This action sets the economy directly up for significant inflation and wages never rise adequately to cover this inflation. The only reason the inflation didn‚Äôt happen in 2010-19 was other mitigating factors. But it happened in 2021. The action of printing money is a debasement and the everyday folks only wind up further behind, while the government exponentially increases its debt. Another catastrophic decision was when America shipped manufacturing offshore, and in step culturally distanced itself from individual self sufficiency that our ancestors had amongst themselves. People now argue socialism is a better alternative, but I am skeptical that this will only result in worsening levels of oppressive government, stifle future innovation, and turn us into a legit 3rd world country as other nations abandon the dollar since they‚Äôre tired of taking on our ever-skyrocketing debt. Sure the US has a lot of gold but I doubt it comes close to paying for the scale of total debt this militarily and financially overextended nation has created. Heavy government involvement in the economy has likely led to whiplash, jerking the economy back and forth as it struggles to fight headwinds of gradually increasing intensity. Home buying has not innovated nearly to the levels it should have (mass production of homes is overdue) and over regulation, rising materials costs and scars of the Great Recession have led to inadequate building. So until massive changes ensue, homeownership is out of the cards of strapped and stricken lower class and middle class Americans."

The opposite is occurring: Western economies are being smashed with higher oil &amp; gas prices. The German economy will take the rest of the EU down with it.<br>Significantly higher oil &amp; gas prices will cause inflation to remain high.  This will put upward pressure on nominal rates. This at the same time as we see record borrowing by the Treasury (due to much higher interest costs) AND a decline in the value of the dollar. The EU is even in worse shape. Most have debt to GDP ratios higher than the US.

They gave untold fortunes to companies and countries now to cover this they are going to make everyone else suffer. Every country has trillions of debt on their books yet this is the only solution they can come up with? What a plan.

Does anyone know the about difference in exposure to business debt obligations between the regional banks versus national/international banks?   <br><br>I wonder if this was done by design like the collateralized debt obligations that were greenlighted en mass during the Pre-Great-Financial-Crisis time period?  My friend worked for one of the lenders&#39; application processors back in 2006-07 and he said it was shady but they paid him good money to greenlight every application so that is what he did.  [The manager got paid good money too and we saw the results of the GFC after 2008].  <br><br>I used to work for a really rich guy that sold the property management/owner part of his umbrella corporation to an international conglomerate that specialized in posh business office properties globally and that was in 2017.   There were also some other odd shady coincidences with that situation/business transaction that rubbed me the wrong way that I&#39;m not going to get into, but it was all too odd and too coordinated to be coincidental.  <br><br>One example would be that I migrated the entire business to the cloud which means they were ready for work from home before the pandemic hit.  I always thought the rush to that cloud migration was very awkward given timing and how out-of-date the technology scheme was before I started working there.  Almost as if the man knew something was going to happen, all the way back in 2017.  Another example is how the owner also happened to be a Jew with a jet who flew around the world and worked hand in hand with a Rothschild property management employee to seize land from slumlords in large blocks so it could be resold to investment groups for development.

To avert a severe economic downturn, an interest rate freeze is vital. Additionally, the White House should support the gas and oil industry to reduce fuel prices, as an anti-oil stance drives up energy costs and inflation. By lowering interest rates, tightening the money supply, cutting government spending, and ensuring affordable fuel, inflation will decrease, and the economy will flourish. Unfortunately, conflicting agendas make full implementation unlikely, leading to recession and persistent inflation. Therefore, focusing on profitable ventures like stocks and crypto is crucial. Optimistic investors are profiting, and Cheryl Atonal&#39;s remarkable guidance deserves credit."

If you compare the first 3 Quarters of 2023, it shows similar performance to 2008&#39;s 2nd and 3rd quarters.

It means to lose (in base value) at the rate of the small return subtracted from the inflation rate.  So if you were earning 2% and inflation is 5% you are losing 3% (roughly) in base value (buying power) year after year.   Even 3% will cause a divsion of this value by far more than half long before a thirty year bond matures.  You will get your dollars but they will be worth far less.  The strategy would rather be to hold only until you can sell if opportunity affords, that is, if you have a chance due to a falling of interest rates.  (Then repurchase at present rates if they look hopeful.)"

You know, just like &quot;financial crisis&quot; was a symptom of capitalism incentivising capitalists to rip off their workers over decades and loan them back the wage rises they never got which they then had to repay in full with interest which was a great scam for capitalists until it all fell apart in 2008 when sufficient numbers of workers could no longer turn over their debts where in turn capitalism collapsed spectacularly leading on to the symptoms of financial crisis. From which most governments have never recovered never mind their peoples."

My bank been in the area for 80 years, used to be called First National, then Lone Star, and now it is merging with Prosperity Bank, also with branches in the region.  This is proof of what you say is true.  Because this is a farm region with medical and educational in Lubbock, pop 300,000, I would expect more bank failures, a lot more.  Lone Star buildings will be empty.  I farm irrigated cotton, drought 2 years in a row, difficult making a crop even with irrigation.  DRUG cartel money buying up land at outrageous prices, via local people.  2020 year, I made a good crop, but operation expenses double in 4 years, price I receive at 80 cents a pound the same for 4 years - lost $45,000, on a good crop with no debt.  The new world order criminals are making their play, looks to me, with hyperinflation one of the driving forces, upcoming years.

All the Trreasuries (and other bonds) sold in the era of very low interest rate are sitting in the portofolio of banks, pension funds, HNW individuals, soverign wealth funds ... They sit there collecting very little interest, but mark to cost in stead of marked to market, until they eventual mature and the principal is paid back. What that means is nobody has to recognise a loss, just a low interest (or ROI) for the duration of the bond. Banks are no different. As long as they don&#39;t have a bank run and be forced to sell the bonds and recognise the losses, all will be fine."

For you to understand what is actually going on with these primary countries and trade settlements is to look behind the curtain. Propaganda is a powerful tool which Russia and China are very masterful. Because these currencies are not asset backed and because these countries dont have the amounts of Gold that would be required they are actually settling in physical gold between themselves. The only way to trade with each other and settle fairly. All the rest is smoke and mirrors until the new QFS goes into effect and then it will still take a few years.

The bailout completely broke FDIC limits of bank consumer protections. Tax payers are on the hook for this without legal requirement. So, the message is clear to large depositors. If you put money in smaller banks, you are only protected to FDIC limits. If you put your money in ‚Äòtoo large to fail‚Äô banks, then your government bailout protections will be more likely to cover the higher deposit.<br><br>Politically, Silicon Valley Bank holds large deposits of extreme Democrat Party supporters. The bank is unarguably a left leaning bank ‚Äî from depositors of all types to leadership and investors. So, the message may be that similarly left leaning, large banks will have a much higher likelihood of Federal bailouts over other banks. Again, I do not have data, but only the chatter around the SVB bailout. I would love to see this subject explored with more research and data."

What both should have done was let the Too Big To Fail Banks -  TBTF - go bankrupt, and then the US govt. take them over and run them in the public interest. Instead of printing more massive amounts of worthless new dollars and lending them to the banks so they could stay in business, both Presidents and Congress just kicked the can down the road so the problem today is far bigger than it was in 2008-09. Back in those days there still was some confidence in the US dollar but that began to evaporate in 2008-09 with the huge govt. bailouts of the TBTF banks and the huge increase of the money supply. But I think are late in coming to the understanding that the banks run the US govt. - not Presidents and not Congress. Of course nowadays most nations around the world are dumping US dollars ASAP and looking towards joining other trading blocs so they no longer have to use US dollars for trade - and that will sink the US dollar even faster than it has sunk so far."

From Vax passports to increased visa requirements and 15-min city initiatives ‚Äì a grid is being constructed to regulate our freedom of movement..<br><br>2. A CBDC is coming. Cash will be eliminated. How restrictive it may end up being, I don‚Äôt know. But, CBDC is a foregone conclusion. Timing? BIS publishes estimates of 14 retail CBDC and 9 wholesale by 2030. And there are indications that the major economies are working to be ready to deploy by 2025.<br><br>3. The digital ID is already here. Biometrics are the future. If you have a government issued ID associated with your photograph, you are in the system already. How the ID is deployed and enforced is the only question.<br><br>4. GFC 2.0 and/or the Greater Depression. Timing is hard. But, can any thinking person imagine how the outcome can be avoided altogether. Simon Hunt suggests a market pullback of up to 30% between now and early 2024 followed by a pump and a deflationary wipeout in 2025.<br><br>5. Most of my financial assets will disappear at some point. Inflation, bank bail-in, market wipe out, or Great Taking. I don‚Äôt know the cause, but I assume physical assets are where I need to be, ultimately.<br><br>6. Increasing crime &amp; disorder. You‚Äôve seen the videos. Whether, driven by economic desperation, mass migration, the inversion of law, or in the name of social justice. Crime and disorder will grow and lead to greater physical threats to our lives and property from our fellow man. This makes urban environments, especially but not exclusively, a real risk.<br><br>7. Supply constraints are increasing around all commodities ‚Äì from food to energy. Tight supplies are showing up everywhere. Live Cattle, long dormant, hit an all-time high recently. Oil Prices are up 30% in the last three months. 40% of Argentina‚Äôs wheat crop is in poor to fair condition and protectionist policies are on the rise globally.<br><br>8. WW3 is coming. A good case can be made that it‚Äôs already begun. The Army War College recently published a study suggesting that the All Volunteer Force had reached the end of its useful life. With the military struggling with recruiting, conscription is likely at some point.<br><br>9. Censorship and Digital Control will enter a new phase. de-platforming, de-banking, shadow banning, and social media account suspensions will increase. Centralized digital services of all kinds should be considered suspect and, very likely, dangerous to use in the future.<br><br>10. The US election ‚Äì regardless of the outcome ‚Äì is an inflection point and potentially a flash point. IF it happens, the outcome will not be accepted by half of the country. I‚Äôve heard from more than one source, publicly and privately, that there may not be a 2024 election. Who knows? We can be sure of is that running up to and shortly after the election, things could get wild. In advance of the 2020 election we had Covid and BLM. Shortly after, J6 and state overreach. What will 2024 bring<br><br>11. There is a war happening today. It‚Äôs a war on us. The primary battleground is within the sphere of 5GW ‚Äì informational/psychological. Where I‚Äôve been wrong in the last three years, it‚Äôs been in my assumption that kinetic coercion would be utilized. As we can see, much progress has been made in the Great Reset without the need for kinetic tactics. For most of this cycle, they will rely on this same approach. If/When we see a move toward kinetic force, we should be alarmed because we will have entered a new and more dangerous phase."

Banks are paying near-zero interest on depositor&#39;s saving and checking accounts, so they are not incentivizing anyone to keep more than they need in savings and checking accounts.  I keep enough in those accounts to cover my expected needs for the short-term future, but that&#39;s it."

Even though I am earning more in interest, with recent spike in 10yr, my Bonds &amp; Preferred funds lost market value and investment balance has gone negative for the year.  Have good cash flow so no need to sell any investments, I can ride it out.  Would like to buy more bonds but so many have low coupon rates since most bonds were issued when Fed rates were zero.  Even though bonds are selling at discount, with low coupons I won&#39;t realize gain until maturity and I don&#39;t want to sit on those bonds for all that time when money markets pay higher yields now."

Inflation has seemed to return recently which would make cutting rates much more difficult. Also the Treasury will have to reissue $9.8 trillion in debt this year just for maturing Securities in addition to Government deficit spending. The Chinese and Japanese governments are not buying Treasuries. The Treqsury will likely have to pay higher rates to bring investment which would offset any interest rate cuts."

Perhaps you remember Donna Tanoue the head of the FDIC going on national TV in the waning days of the Clinton administration saying the banks had never been stronger? Many people from Hawaii remembered Tanoue on state television telling everyone that the S&amp;L‚Äôs were strong. This was to stop the rush on the S&amp;L‚Äôs when they were struggling.

Hence the refinancing interest on the collateralized bonds will drop. This is basic interest rate risk management. By the way, what is interesting concerning the threat on  US banks is not the bankruptcy contagion risk, but the actual risks contained in the balance sheet of these banks and accordingly what are the procedures to manage the liquidity and markets risks. The final collapse pf the US banking system has been trumpeted so many times, that it has become a no story, just the repeat of the same procedures to keep the system alive another time by the FED.

The FED simply repurchases the degraded assets on the repo market, in order to solve the liquidity problem of the commercial banks.

As an actor/director  I know a person&#39;s eyes and voice can reveal much about their thoughts and emotions at any given moment,  often more than what words alone can express. I have in fact noticed several times (the  farmers protest in Europe for example) where I could discern in your eyes and voice that you were very concerned about the situation you were reporting on. I also believe these concerns are on your mind more often than most of us may have considered here because you spend so much  time researching  these  matters, and because of your research, the deeper understanding you have of the potential pitfalls we are all facing because of our wicked leaders. I am sure at times this can take a toll on you.

As Putin executed his folly and ruined Russia for generations it became completely pro-Russian and anti-western.  The biggest asset bubble in the world is China.  The worst returns on investment in the past 30 year have been Russia.  She is silent on those fronts.  The reality is that the USA is getting stronger and BRICs is a goddamn joke of a thing.   117 Billion in commercial notes is due in the whole of the USA this year, but the cash shortfall of of the Evergrande and Country Garden bankruptcies is 500Billion.  Thats only two companies.  The entire Russian GDP for an entire year is less than a month of American GDP.  117 Billion in real estate notes is a .005% hit on GDP assuming that the loans have 0% value which they do not.  Banks are closed in the USA earlier than in any other country for non-performance.  Every bank in China is insolvent years ago by US banking standards."

UCBdH9UbYg11jTPvnUJPy4fQ,@Decoy0527,2024-02-09T01:37:41Z,"When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed there was great danger that enormous depositor cash withdrawals wood take place.  US banking regulators and insurer (FDIC) could not handle that occurrence so two major regulatory changes were approved,.  1.  Deposit insurance limit was increased.  2.  An accounting change permitted banks with liquidIty problems to transfer to the Fed their underwater Treasures at book value rather than market value.  That was a very big deal, but one that didn&#39;t resolve the issue except to delay recognition of the losses.   Now a year later banks can add commercial loan delinquencies to the previous problem.  I&#39;m sure there is an attempt right now to approve more gimmicky regulatory changes to kick the commercial RE problem down the road.  Politicians can get very creative  (and unethical) in circumstances like this.  It will be interesting to see what they come up with."

Biggest increases in open interest during the COT week were on big down days where the sellers are the specs and the buyers are the banks. In that case the increase in open interest is bullish. Any further drop in silver will be used by banks to get long before the coming silver rocket, maybe after an insanely overvalued stock market smash (coming soon?). Given insane industrial demand for silver the next rally will not be sold by banksters. It will be epic."

UCd855uf_ztu_JDWKdyyhyJA,@user-cr4hv9lq1p,2024-02-08T02:06:12Z,"It&#39;s true, I retained my doubts on the present environment. But YPK22X is truly smart. It doesn&#39;t matter how old you are; this will deliver for you and your family, which is my sole goal in the recent years. I have to make sure the children are fine."
UCAcmFTY2BGpOlw0VgM4wtBw,@emilioalcazar4431,2024-02-08T02:06:05Z,"So the foundation for this year to become the golden one is established in stone. ETF endorsement, halving are the things people talk about it, but the genuine truth is that YPK22X has more of a role than any of these. You indeed believe it comes down to what mainstream media tells you? If you consider that, then you napped the last ten years, and you should indeed wake up. Having the strongest brand in the world making their own asset, that&#39;s something which matters, and that is what I would encourage you to understand."

The Repo program is almost broke. The markets are way over bought, China is a ticking time bomb of collapsing real estate banks, and it&#39;s people are all too old to pay back their national debts. We currently have a huge divergence in the NASDAQ, and relative to 2000, it is even more over bought. The Russell   will not make a new high before it all comes unglued. A Real Estate price collapse will be brutal. And Nat Gas is topping. I would get out of stock and real estate because 40% of all homes bought from 2021 to 2023 were done by corporate investors, and when everything goes south they will dump their holdings. Buckle up butter cups because you may wake up in a short period of time and find the markets down thousands of points. 150 trillion in derivatives will unwind and that will crush it all."

Maybe some charts of fundamental principles important for the discussion in hand, then charts explaining discrepancies/deviations which allowed fraud/corruption/mistakes etc. If you don&#39;t have time to do it, would you be fine if someone else does it for you and sends it to you to share to the audience?

Benefited the larger banks and even created a bull market in european banks as the bulk of their customers is old economy, short duration and far more diversified in assets/ liabilities... boring became sexy again and while nasdaq fell 90pct and specialized banks went under, EU banks went up. Not at all the same as 2008 which was a time where large banks were the problem as they had far less capital constraints. Funny thought: in the US the least valued of the large bank is Citi as ROE is low... but just like EU banks it trades at a massive discount to tangible book... and yet out of all US large banks it is the safest due to the diversity of its income (products, geography, industries)... lower ROE simply because it is more boring, went from one extreme to the other after 2008"

The Fed is rate hiking so fast that the banks are building unrealized losses from treasury bonds at an alarming rate as bond values fall on the short end. Meanwhile long term bonds are locked in place until maturity. As people run to the banks those unrealized losses are becoming realized. Silicon Valley Bank was pretty conservative and safe with their loans. If they can go under all banks are in trouble.

Most in these industries network and share strategies. If this bank was doing things that made them insolvent, other banks were likely doing the same. While FDIC will return $250k in deposits to the individuals, companies had millions of dollars stored there. For most startups that will crunch their balance sheets. While this may not touch the largest banks,who knows, at minimum this will increase layoffs.

I know you hate crypto and millenials living in the moms basements, but please keep to the truth.<br><br>Silvergate crashed because of good, old-fashioned greed. Silvergate had, as you said at #<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxcwn7xoXhU&amp;t=870"">14:30</a> invested a lot of their customers deposits in these hold-to-maturity bonds, these &quot;agency bonds&quot;: bonds that mature some 4-5 years into the future.<br><br>Investopedia (which I choose to trust on this matter - your mileage may wary) describes these agency bonds as follows:<br><br>- &quot;An agency bond is a security issued by a government-sponsored enterprise or by a federal government department other than the U.S. Treasury. Some are not fully guaranteed in the same way that U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds are.<br>[...]<br>Treasury bonds are attractive to investors because of their safety, liquidity, and state tax- exempt interest. Agency bonds are attractive to investors because of the safety, liquidity, higher yields relative to Treasuries, and for some agencies, their state tax-exempt interest.&quot;<br><br>The problem with these hold-to-maturity bonds is that when Silvergate bought them at &quot;fair value&quot; just a few years or months ago, the US interest rate was much lower than today. And bond values correlates inverse to interest rate, so now with the current and continuing FED raises of interests, the value of these fixed interest bonds goes down.<br><br>Now, as all of us &quot;knows&quot; you really haven&#39;t lost money in the stock market until you sell your bad performing stonks. Same with Silvergate. On their accounting books, these agency bonds was reported and valued at their original price, not their new fair value taking the current interest rate into account. It was only when Silvergate customers started to withdraw deposits and Silvergate needed good old fashioned fiat US Dollars to keep up with the withdrawals, the problem with the original fair value not being fair any longer became a problem. The agency bonds, held until maturity, which paid out (guessing here 2 % in interests) was simply worth a lot less when newly issued federal bonds promised 3-4 % interest with a lot shorter life span and shorter risk. So Silvergate, which had been too greedy when investing in these agency bonds, was forced to sell and realise a significant loss in the billions of US Dollars range. That was what brought down Silvergate. It was greed not &quot;crypto-related events&quot;."

If they have $50 million in deposits and give a $10 million loan, they‚Äôre not taking the equivalent of $10 million out of everybody else‚Äôs savings, they are creating credit and a promissory note is issued. They are credit creators, not intermediaries, this is where so much stuff to do with banking goes wrong. They don‚Äôt lend money they have on the books, they create a credit out of thin air and make their money back on interest, which is also why is a source of inflation over time. And is why there is more credit in the system and actual hard-currency. This wouldn‚Äôt be the case in a system where banks are just intermediaries because every dollar would have a corresponding dollar. That‚Äôs not what we have."

I‚Äôm not saying you specifically are, but a lot of youtubers are. I only hope some may see how disastrous being excessive can be"

Because they were forced to sell their bonds on the secondary market to meet capitalization requirements (rather than hold the bonds to maturity as planned) they got into trouble."

UCKM_HYpoCAfkRdUF8jpi05g,@mxvega1097,2023-03-10T22:31:35Z,"I think Levine is half right - this particular problem and crypto&#39;s hypertrophic growth were enabled by QE and rates compression, but it&#39;s also a failure of small institutions to manage risk in a way that the wider market actually requires. If they want to remain viable while taking on big chunks of novel, synthetic, potentially illiquid, and mismatched liabilities they need to get in the game of managing for the unthinkable - in a big bank the trading desks or RM would be running sensitivity analysis on FFR rises right from the first JPow announcement - what would happen if rates rose 25-50-75bp-quarterly out to a 5% terminal rate, or 6% etc, or the Full Volcker. The desk would then have scenarios to hedge against, mainly interest rate swaps, which could also blow up but at least they have the capacity to engage in relatively sophisticated hedging. Smaller banks, no matter what their asset base looks like, if they&#39;re small they have a narrow and shallow pool of expertise and experience to run a difficult - but necessary - irs swaps program. In a very real sense complexity and market structure favor the big banks and funds, and small banks end up being the first penguin to toddle off the ice shelf, eaten by the hungriest seal waiting below."
UCRYY-AZLDRIRxG7ts-Y8bLQ,@johnbailey3351,2023-03-10T22:31:20Z,"Bank runs!  During the GFC, I worked at a small community bank.  In early-to-mid 2008, depositors that exceeded the FDIC limit, started to take their excess funds out of one local bank and put it into one or more other local banks.  They often had to wait for their CDs to mature.  The only thing this did was to keep those who opened new accounts VERY busy.  By mid-to-late 2008, things changed and people wanted to take cash home.  I was a lender, but I got up to five calls per day from customers wanted to get their hands on $5k to $50k and I would help as best I could.  Finally the FDIC raised the insurance limit and everything calmed down pretty quickly.  The problem with SVB was that 90% of its deposits were uninsured meaning that the average depositor at SVB had $2,500,000 on deposit, hence $250k insured and $2.25 million uninsured.  I predict a lot banks with large depositors will drop the interest paid on large accounts downward, while brokering CDs to smaller depositors.  It will hurt their net interest margin and profits, but will reduce the impact of bank runs.  That or the FDIC and/or Fed will &quot;do something&quot;. What I have no idea, but the quicker the better."

Higher i-rate shifts both demand curves and supply curves to the left, double reducing consumer goods sales and not necessarily lowering prices and in fact probably increasing them.  In deflationary depression firms &quot;stagflate&quot; prices, raising costs more and more in response to fewer buyers in order to cover fixed costs of rent and interest and increased prices from likewise-responding input suppliers."

Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they&#39;ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket.

It would have been nice to spend more time talking about the situation with SVB because it has wider implications and could be applicable to many other banks. The unrealized bank losses on bonds, currently standing at about $700 billion, are a financial nuclear bomb that can blow up the entire banking system, as people start moving their money from non-interest bearing current accounts to CDs and other safe interest bearing instruments returning 4-5%."

UCohAY4ilO19vv8SAwBKfvKg,@Jim-Tuner,2023-03-10T21:07:05Z,"1) After 2008, the fed demands that the banks increase their safe reserves.<br>2) The banks respond by creating new big portfolios of ultra-safe assets. Namely long-term US treasury bonds.<br>3) Nobody at the fed or the banks thinks at all about the impact of interest rates on those portfolios. Or the impact on actual bank liquidity with rising interest rates.<br>4) So now we have suddenly realized today that the &quot;safe&quot; long-term assets that represent reserves are incredibly ill-liquid in the face of rising interest rates and were never as safe as they seemed.<br><br>Big things have small beginnings. The last time all this happened was in the 1980s. It happened with mortgages and savings &amp; loans in an environment of rising interest rates."

UCECcNspG60iB4w3zfrkSXkQ,@leonardmayer2362,2023-03-24T17:03:50Z,SVB provides an opportunity for experimentation. I would have entered It‚Äôs investment portfolio into a computer to determine its present value and its value six months ago. Then I would have entered alternative investments and let a computer make substitutions in investments to see which would optimize profits based on what was available. Then I would fast forward to see that what the investment portfolio would do in six months to present. I would also try to predict what would happen if the mix of interest bearing bonds and mortgages were subject to decreases in interest rates or no change in interest rates. I would let the computer evaluate whatever combination of mortgages and bonds would do six months into the future with rising interest rates. This would reveal the best approach of SVB to stay afloat and not go bankrupt. For the FED to just take over and absorb the loss does not solve the problem. It only resets the situation.

Gold is fine, but there are 100 claims for every physical ounce of gold that exists outside of the industrial/jewelry use. Consequently, most people who think they hold gold don‚Äôt,  they hold a chip in the gold casino.  Further as the 30s proved, gold is not safe in the United States. Unless you‚Äôve got a personal safe and even then the developing police state might not have a problem of kicking down your door and taking it. The pseudonymous nature of bitcoin and its ability to be transferred with a little to no effort provides gold qualities with further protections from confiscation."

UC-i85CjQ1fUc6HUTK7AHphg,@Sylvia-of9hj,2024-02-04T18:24:20Z,"What does JR think of the US&#39; possibly joining the Commonwealth of Nations? I believe that the US will join because in Bible prophecy, Ezekiel 38:13 shows a group of nations, all speaking together in one voice, protesting the invasion of Israel. The group in Ezekiel 38:13 is the Merchants of Tarshish and ALL her Young Lions. The operative word here being ALL. So who are they? First of all, they&#39;re merchants, so this is an economic/trading group of nations. Tarshish in the Bible is England. England&#39;s mascot is the lion, so the &quot;Young Lions&quot; are all of the nations that have come out of the British Empire in the past 200 plus-or-minus years. So, all these nations are speaking as one, in unison, all speaking with one voice to protest invasion of Israel. And Israel is what? Israel is many things, but one of her identities can be found as a former colony of the British Empire, that is, a Young Lion. And the only countries in the Middle East who&#39;ve had lasting peace treaties with Israel are Egypt and Jordan, which are also Young Lions, which shows the important cultural ties that Young Lions countries have with each other.<br> The US will certainly join the Commonwealth, because Ezekiel 38:13 shows ALL the Young Lions speaking in unison, and it will grow into the biggest, richest trading and economics group in the world, and that the impetus for this success of the Commonwealth will be the distrust much of the world feels for the dishonesty and aggressiveness of China, and other shady allies of China, including Iran, N. Korea, and probably Russia &amp; Turkey.  China and the other BRICs nations seem to be the opposing group, the ‚Äú10 Kings‚Äù of Biblical prophecy. <br>The point is that the world is splitting into two, and many nations with Western cultures are looking for trading partners with cultural and economic ties. At the same time, I believe that Charles III is the AntiChrist. Now can we deal with some devils? Of course we can--we&#39;ve got plenty of them here in the US already! Many Bible prophecy experts today are saying that the &quot;10 Kings&quot; are BRICS, who the Bible describes as getting their temporary power from &quot;the dragon.&quot; In the meantime, God says he will &quot;put a hook in their jaw&quot; of the countries that invade Israel. And there&#39;s unanimous agreement that the &quot;hook&quot; is economic. So BRICS isn&#39;t going to be doing well financially. In the meantime, at the time of the invasion, Israel is depicted as living well and in security and in unwalled cities. The Young Lions countries united in an economic and trading group will certainly be very prosperous. Israel itself has recently discovered a great cache of oil off its coasts and also has enough fertilizer to feed the world in the Dead Sea. Egypt and Canada have the two biggest sea trading routes in the Suez Canal and the Northwest Passage. The Young Lions would have had another of the greatest sea routes, had not the US given up control of the Panama Canal! <br>The Merchants of Tarshish and ALL her Young Lions (MOTYL, that is the Commonwealth) will include all of the Young Lions, plus some other countries, because entities of &quot;Sheba and Dedan&quot; are also mentioned. Some people have commented that the Merchants of Tarshish and ALL her Young Lions are a weakened group because they only protest the invasion of Israel, but don&#39;t do anything militarily. But that&#39;s only because this is an economic group, not a military group. On the military side of things, the UK and some other Young Lions, including the US, have formed AUKUS, and this group could also grow to include countries that are not Young Lions, such as S. Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia &amp; the Philippines, at the very least. But the most important member of AUKUS would certainly be India, when they are invited to join.<br>Originally, I had thought that the Merchants of Tarshish and ALL her Young Lions was the trading group now forming called CANZUK. But CANZUK requires allegiance to the British throne, and I can&#39;t imagine the US agreeing to that. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, has in its charter that member nations are independent, and don&#39;t have to pledge to a king. Most of the countries in the Commonwealth are republics, like the US. About 3 or so do pledge allegiance to the British Monarchy. And I think about 12 have their own monarchies."
UC-i85CjQ1fUc6HUTK7AHphg,@Sylvia-of9hj,2024-02-04T16:49:17Z,"I think Johnson and the Congress members who want to take Russia&#39;s money &amp; give it to Ukraine know exactly what they are doing because THE  GOAL OF THESE CONGRESSPEOPLE IS TO CRASH THE US ECONOMY IN ORDER TO BRING IN CBDC.  If you believe that CBDC will  be for the rich then you probably believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny!  John Kerry &amp; Bill Gates don&#39;t plan to be giving up their private jets. And Weffers at Davos still plan to be eating as much steak and drinking as much champagne as they want, while they want to consign the rest of the population to eating bugs, riding bicycles, and living in Nazi style ghettos, aka, &quot;15-minute cities,&quot; the purpose of which is to identify &amp; isolate people for extermination.<br>  The two-tier economy that the Weffers, globalists, and most of the US Congress plan gives them plenty of offshore havens for their cash to live lives of luxury.  Switzerland, the haven for criminals, is first, and has already passed laws exempting itself from the CBDC gulag.  But some 20 other countries have also exempted themselves from CBDC.  So the globalists plan a two-tier economy where they live like kings, and the rest of the people will &quot;own nothing&quot; and &quot;be happy.&quot;  What the globalists plan is an actual return to feudalism with a ruling bloodline elite.  So I think many Congress people have been promised a privileged place in this elite ruling class."

With Jim&#39;s definition of Bitcoin as a &quot;casino chip&quot;, then every other countries currency outside the country that issued it, is a &quot;casino chip&quot;. Try and spend a &quot;bolivar&quot; or &quot;peso&quot; or &quot;rupee&quot; outside the country of issuance. The US dollar is a &quot;casino chip&quot; as well. Why? because  just like Las Vegas , the worlds economy will  accept a popular chip as money; Caesar&#39;s palace chips carry great value and are accepted or will be converted one for one in any other casino!

With the advent of floating exchange rates, the IMF redefined the SDR as a weighted average of the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the currencies that eventually comprised the euro. The dollar has the largest weight, currently about 40 percent, so changes in the dollar impact the SDRs more than similar changes in the pound, yen, or euro. Because of its construction, however, the SDR will likely be more stable relative to other currencies than the dollar; so, holding a portfolio of SDRs is liable to present a country with less exchange-rate valuation risk than holding dollars.<br><br>Unfortunately, the World will not agree, so you have the BRICs+ circling the wagons against the US$; however, there is no real agreement amongst those countries. We are in the second inning regarding a BRICS+ currency na dwe shall; se how it plays out over the next few years. Until Saudi Arabia decides to STOP taking US$s for oil, nothing is going to happen."

What that means for the dollar value of one Bitcoin I have no idea, but the market can decide that. And as the ability to own things becomes more scarce (eg ‚ÄúBy tventy sirty yoo vill own nussink unt yoo vill be heppy!‚Äù) then things like Bitcoin will become more valuable to people. That‚Äôs why I have a little bit of Bitcoin: just to support its principle, despite the risks of ownership from various hostilities."

The dollar collapses and what are you going to do with the gold?  You won‚Äôt want the worthless dollar, you can‚Äôt barter it because no one will want to convert it to worthless dollars, the gold dealers may disappear or not have the worthless dollars to give you, the coin shops may be closed due to social unrest, you can‚Äôt eat it.  People will not want your gold or silver for food, medicine, ammo, baby formula, gasoline.  Without fiat currency gold is just another metal like lead.  The gold only has value if you can exchange it for fiat currency, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs denominated in dollars or whatever.<br>Of course, the sales people who are constantly telling people to buy gold, who are making a nice commission on each sale, will tell you that the dollar is trash all while eagerly taking your worthless dying dollars‚Ä¶ Hmmm.  I would be cautious about having too much of your wealth in precious metals.  Just food for thought.  I do respect Jim and enjoy his YouTube commentaries but just couldn‚Äôt ignore his evasion of the question about not converting his gold to dollars.  At some point he will have to do that."

Here is a use case for him: You are in Vancouver and have hired a guy in Nigeria to do some work, the work is done but the Nigerian doesn&#39;t have a bank account, there is no way to pay him. He can download a bitcoin wallet and you can pay him, no third party required. Bitcoin is internet money, it allows you to pay people without the need for a third party and without any third party intercepting it. I think Jim has to know this so why doesn&#39;t he like it?"

Well, what if I told you they fell for a track with the federal reserve lifted collateral lending requirements in 2020 and they were ham. Currently there are two bars of US treasury Europe and the federal reserve with a yield curve inversion in the United States.

But for practically everyone who doesn‚Äôt live in the country with the largest economy in the world, it‚Äôs going to be a double bummer. This is because the US Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, will now feel empowered to raise interest rates even further to curb inflation.<br><br>Unfortunately, sometimes the problem is greater than the remedy. Parts of the global economy will collapse if the Fed does raise rates aggressively. The impacts will be felt beyond its national jurisdiction. The global recession will in turn have an impact on US economic growth. The world of unexpected repercussions will then suddenly become our focus<br><br>The trajectory of the two-year US Treasury yields, which are followed by international bond markets, is alarming for countries and currencies that are unable to keep up with the rates.<br>The yields were 0.2% at this time last year; they are now 19 times greater. And this is all before the Fed begins its aggressive $95 billion monthly quantitative tightening program. It truly hasn‚Äôt had time to evaluate the results of its brisk hiking. The dollar is the world‚Äôs reserve currency, like it or not. If cash dries up due to increased rates, everyone outside of the US will be affected.<br><br>The most recent Bank of America global survey of fund managers, released on Tuesday, reveals the largest underweight of global stocks in its history. You won‚Äôt run the risk of losing your job as an investment analyst if you solely use dollar-denominated assets or currencies. It‚Äôs hard to predict what will change this way of thinking.<br><br>When the dollar is getting stronger, other economies and markets have a very difficult time competing. As the Fed‚Äôs rapid interest rate increases force ever-faster flights to quality, that omnipotence is destroying many of the world‚Äôs currencies.<br><br>Imagine Japan. The yen has fallen more than 25% versus the dollar in the last year, to its lowest level since 1990. Due to the need to import the majority of its energy and pay for it in dollars, the nation‚Äôs export-led economic advantage over the US has crumbled.<br>The Bank of Japan has been compelled to strengthen its currency defence. Active intervention is now a real option, and it would likely be financed by selling its holdings of US Treasury notes.<br><br>The BOJ was the only major central bank for a considerable amount of time content to embrace inflation as a road to growth for its sluggish economy. Finally, prints above its 2% threshold are being seen. It also kept a tight hold on its bond market to keep interest rates low, and even negative.<br>It cannot, however, do either of these things and stop the downward trend of its currency. It can only allow the yen to fall so much or so quickly. And the Chinese yuan, Korean won, and Taiwan dollar will all suffer as a result. The BOJ‚Äôs approach might be destroyed, upsetting the rest of Asia, if the dollar experiences yet another period of strength fueled by a new rate hike from the Fed.<br>In the event of an unwelcome currency decline, China will feel justified in retaliating in kind. It usually strictly regulates it, but during the past six months, it has had to let the yuan lose more than 10% of its value against the dollar. Even the second-largest currency in the world is powerless against the American inflationary wave.<br><br>Since the spring of last year, the euro and the pound have been battling out for the lowest dollar value on the opposite side of Eurasia. Europe is already deprived by the amount of money spent to combat the pandemic, and because it relies on Russian natural gas, it is also now in the crosshairs of the energy crisis.<br>Growth is rapidly vanishing in front of our eyes as the UK has been stagnating all year and several countries in the European Union are entering a recession. According to economists at Deutsche Bank AG, the German economy could fall by as much as 4% in 2019.<br>Likewise to the Fed Reserve, the European Central Bank as well as the Bank of England predict parallel declines in the liquidity of the banking system, suspensions of asset acquisitions for money creation, and significant rate rises.<br><br>All that enter here, abandon hope.<br><br>We practically let the Fed set interest rates for the entire world, therefore this is what will happen. However, Fed Chair Powell and his countrymen are determined by myopia since all they can see is the oversaturated American labour market. The ensuing financial arms race runs the potential of being disastrous.<br>The fact is that not every economy needs to have ever-rising borrowing costs to stifle demand; a large part of global inflation is external and driven by supply-side factors.<br><br>And since COVID-19 struck in 2020 and severely slowed down globalization, the world has undergone a profound transformation. The response of the Fed and other central banks is unchanged, though.<br><br>Greater flexibility is needed to halt and restart the global economy than what the harsh mechanism of interest rates can provide. Weaning financial markets and asset prices away from continuous cycles of quantitative easing is a positive thing. The Fed has, yet, twice mishandled the unwinding procedure.<br>Why do central banks keep trying to hammer a 2 per cent inflation target pin into the head of massive economies when it is no longer desirable or viable to do so? Surely it‚Äôs time to move away from precise numbers and towards a flexible range. Although base effects would certainly cause headline inflation to fall significantly next year anyhow, bringing core inflation, which excludes food and energy, back to much lower levels will be extremely costly from an economic standpoint.<br>The US Fed‚Äôs efforts will eventually backfire on both the US and the Fed. By then, all of the pandemic‚Äôs trillions of dollars worth of stimulus work will have been undone‚Äîwhat a staggering waste of time, resources, and energy.<br><br>Interest rate hikes are putting the world economy in threat of entering a recession in 2023.<br><br>The US Federal Reserve Board will convene once more on September 20‚Äì21. There is a solid argument for the Federal to halt its unrelenting tightening of monetary policy, even if the majority of economists predict the next big hike in interest rates.<br>A spate of financial crises in emerging markets and developing countries, in addition to the recession, is also anticipated to do them ‚Äúpermanent harm,‚Äù the report stated. Compared to the period leading up to prior global recessions, the loss in worldwide consumer confidence has already been much more severe.<br>According to a World Bank analysis, major central banks around the world have been rising interest rates this year with an extent of coherence that has not been seen in the last 50 years, and this trend is likely to continue far into next year."

Paper currency has led to the collapse of many economies that have tried to institute a fiat currency to trade for goods and services, yet the long history of failed fiat currency is being ignored by today‚Äôs central banks and governments.<br>Because fiat money is not linked to physical reserves, it risks losing value due to inflation or even becoming worthless in the event of hyperinflation. When people lose faith in a nation‚Äôs currency, the money will no longer be of any value. That differs from currency backed by gold, for example; it has intrinsic value because of the demand for gold.<br>Since fiat money is not a scarce or fixed resource like gold, central banks have much greater control over its supply, which gives them the power to manage economic variables such as credit supply, liquidity and interest rates.<br>When governments began printing paper money these notes were considered to be as good as gold.<br>In theory, everyone who held this paper currency could go to a bank or financial institution and convert their currency into physical gold. This is what became known as the gold standard. Initially, the governments only printed as much currency as they had physical gold to back it up.<br>But soon they realised realized that the physical commodity backing the currency was tying them down from unbridled spending and also that a situation where everyone went to exchange their currency for gold would likely never happen. So, they began to print more paper money, thus creating the fractional banking system.<br>The manipulation of fiat money quickly resulted in the manipulation of fiat debt, benefitting a select few and ruining the rest.<br><br>The US dollar became fiat currency when it stopped being backed by gold over 46 years ago and it has lost 97 per cent of its value since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913.<br>Examples of failed fiat currencies<br>China was the first country to use paper money in the 7th century.<br>This worked briefly since the paper could be traded for rare, valuable metals, such as gold and silver but as China entered into a costly war with Mongolia and in an effort at expansion started to flood paper money throughout the empire.

Of course, nobody actually thought that the Americans would truly default at this time. After all, the Americans can quite literally print dollars to pay their debt. But it is also possible that the USA has entered a state of decline: massive public and private debts without growth quickly leads to collapse.<br>While it is a clich√©, I am fascinated by the analogy between the American superpower and the fall of the Roman Empire. The economics of the Roman Empire during its decline bear some similarity to our current situation.<br>Rome partially moved away from a gold-based currency some time during its decline. It started to mint coins with less gold content. Similarly, the Americans switched to a fiat currency in the seventies under Nixon. The American government no longer guarantees a gold equivalent for the American dollar. In both cases, the currency became backed by the great economical and military power of the government. Unfortunately, this type of backing loses its efficiency when a decline is hinted. Your dollars are only valuable if you think that the USA will keep growing stronger. If you think that the American economy might suffer on the long term, then American dollars are much less interesting. Thus, predictions of decline become self-fulfilling.<br>During the fall of the Roman Empire, many citizens were enticed to borrow from the super wealthy. Eventually, the peasant class was wiped out: they became serfs. Serfs live in conditions where they cannot possibly expect to improve their conditions. They constantly owe more than they earn. They are, effectively, slaves.<br>The Catholic Church, which emerged at the time, correspondingly considered usury to be a sin. While it seems that the stance of the Catholic Church on usury is quite a bit more flexible today, religions like Islam still forbid usury. Judaism only allows usury toward non-Jews.<br>What is usury? Lending money knowing that it will make people poorer. Correspondingly, most consumer debt is usury. It is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich which makes us, overall, poorer. Lending money to Greece at this time is also usury.<br>Could the religious stance against usury be wise?<br>Economists who expect people to be rational won‚Äôt believe in usury. Surely, people borrow money to be better off. Yet the average credit card debt per household is over $15,000 in the USA (and it grows all the time, of course). Does anyone believe that these $15,000 are invested in highly profitable ventures? (They would need to be highly profitable since credit cards often charge over 15% for loans.)"

UC8m3nf08CyJpTpEQCmMZYVA,@stephenwatts2649,2024-01-30T20:18:13Z,"DEPT: THE END GAME<br>The Great Inflation was the defining macroeconomic event of the second half of the twentieth century. Over the nearly two decades it lasted, the global monetary system established during World War II was abandoned, there were four economic recessions, two severe energy shortages, and the unprecedented peacetime implementation of wage and price controls. It was, according to one prominent economist, ‚Äúthe greatest failure of American macroeconomic policy in the postwar period‚Äù (Siegel 1994).<br>But that failure also brought a transformative change in macroeconomic theory and, ultimately, the rules that today guide the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. If the Great Inflation was a consequence of a great failure of American macroeconomic policy, its conquest should be counted as a triumph.<br><br>Forensics of the Great Inflation<br><br>In 1964, inflation measured a little more than 1 percent per year. It had been in this vicinity over the preceding six years. Inflation began ratcheting upward in the mid-1960s and reached more than 14 percent in 1980. It eventually declined to average only 3.5 percent in the latter half of the 1980s.<br>While economists debate the relative importance of the factors that motivated and perpetuated inflation for more than a decade, there is little debate about its source. The origins of the Great Inflation were policies that allowed for an excessive growth in the supply of money‚ÄîFederal Reserve policies.<br><br>Monetary policy lives in the shadow of debt. US federal debt held by the public was about 25 percent of GDP in 1980, when Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker started raising rates to tame inflation. Now, it is 100 percent of GDP and rising quickly, with no end in sight. When the Fed raises interest rates 1 percentage point, it raises the interest costs on debt by 1 percentage point, and, at 100 percent debt to GDP, 1 percent of GDP is about $227 billion. A 7.5 percent interest rate therefore creates interest costs of 7.5 percent of GDP, or $1.7 trillion.<br>Where will those trillions of dollars come from? Congress could drastically cut spending or find ways to increase tax revenues. Alternatively, the US Treasury could try to borrow additional trillions. But for that option to work, bond buyers must be convinced that a future Congress will cut spending or raise tax revenues by the same trillions of dollars, plus interest. Even if investors seem confident at the moment, we cannot assume that they will remain so indefinitely, especially if additional borrowing serves only to pay higher interest on existing debt. Even for the United States, there is a point at which bond investors see the end coming and demand even higher interest rates as a risk premium, thereby raising debt costs even more, in a spiral that leads to a debt crisis or to a sharp and uncontrollable surge of inflation. If the US government could borrow arbitrary amounts and never worry about repayment, it could send its citizens checks forever and nobody would have to work or pay taxes again. Alas, we do not live in that fanciful world.<br>In sum, for higher interest rates to reduce inflation, they must be accompanied by credible and persistent fiscal tightening, now or later. If the fiscal tightening does not come, higher interest rates will eventually fail to contain inflation.<br>This is a perfectly standard proposition, though it is often overlooked when discussing the US and Europe. It is embodied in the models used by the US Fed and other central banks. It was standard International Monetary Fund advice for decades.<br>Successful inflation and currency stabilization almost always includes monetary and fiscal reform, and usually microeconomic reform. The role of fiscal and microeconomic reform is to generate sustainably higher tax revenues by boosting economic growth and broadening the tax base, rather than with sharply higher and growth-reducing marginal tax rates. Many attempts at monetary stabilization have fallen apart because the fiscal or microeconomic reforms failed. Latin American economic history is full of such episodes."

They know that their whole business is based on trust and access, If customers don&#39;t trust their access to withdrawing their money, then they will close their accounts and thus force the collapse of the entire banking system. Which is a very real possibility if they start dictating transaction types. As Canada recently did to citizen bank customers for supporting the Trucker strikes."

It‚Äôs the reason the big banks currently have a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve for instituting a larger margin collateral requirement against their liabilities.

You&#39;re simply not looking deep enough you are overlooking the essential Banks and for that you may suffer huge financial psychological and even mental liabilities as a result..... and that is a fair assumption because if you don&#39;t understand the root cause of a problem you can never address it but then you&#39;re only left with the ability to address the symptoms with bandages that require stitches which Stanley is to infection and early preventable death..... are you starting to get the picture???

When banks get into trouble they used to ask for a bail out IE taxpayer money or private investment. Bail in is similar. If you have a bank account and get interest you are classed as an investor and so the bank through Bank bail in will take money from your account and offer you worthless shares. Read up on the silicon Bank fiasco. The investors who had a lot of money were given advanced knowledge about the Banks failure and so were able to withdraw their money in advance. While we the people lost our money. Look up Bank bail in

The WEF is not trying to make the world better - it&#39;s trying to get total control over the world&#39;s financial system and everything that could prevent that from happening is going to be attacked and/or suppressed so the world bankers in the form of the FED, IMF, World Bank and BIS can get total control over the world economy and individual freedoms.

The likely explanation for this censorship is that they want to implement policies that effect us; policies that they know will be unpopular. Since we commoners, outside their elite circles, now have social media platforms that we can use to both complain and alert others, they can&#39;t easily pull the wool over our eyes. So they will target for take down these complaints and warnings as misinformation and disinformation. <br><br>They can&#39;t control all relevant information; but they can censor enough people to assure that the numbers of us who are aware, are not enough to stop them.

They told me that it is A.I that is monitoring social media and sometimes A.I is getting it incorrect. So the banks dont have to employ people to monitor socials . They are employing AI to do the job. Th ECB wants to rebuild trust ? Trust is earned. The Central Banks say one thing and do another . They cannot be trusted. Censorship is a violation of our freedom of speech. We cannot stand for this. If the people want to take their money from the bank en mass then we are also free to do this. Where is the freemarket economy of the west ? Who are the communists ? East or West ? i am confused . The Western Central Banking system is playing with fire üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• .

UCiEdNo2OC4dUJzQrgpvafEQ,@dtrout,2024-01-26T07:00:31Z,"The US Fed has absorbed massive toxic loans from banks temporarily under the Bank Funding program.  The funds will no longer be available after mid-March 2024 unless the US Fed extends the program.  However, I heard one online expert explain that new funds won‚Äôt be available to banks, but it will take up to a year for the ‚Äúbuyback‚Äù process to complete‚Ä¶. where banks buy back the toxic (low interest mortgage backed) loans and finally have to quantify the anticipated loss on those loans. As the buyback takes place and banks book the losses (because they are paying higher rates to keep deposits from moving to Tbills vs what the long term mortgage securities are generating) ‚Ä¶ the bank liquidity will be more accurately quantified and will be considerably lower than what is showing on their financial statements today.  The question will be how many banks will be barely above water and how many will have to be taken over and sold to bigger banks that have bigger reserves‚Ä¶. and will depositors begin converting to cash and precious metals.  This seems highly likely and conspiracy theories will likely say it‚Äôs by design so the CBDC can be implemented and have far fewer banks to deal with that interact with the public.  And a banking crisis that threatens the loss of wealth would be a strong incentive for the public to agree to CBDC rather than traditional banking and cash.  I‚Äôve heard reports that the NY Fed is already running a CBDC system with several banks and corporate customers.  I don‚Äôt know if this component is true but three years ago the Biden administration took office and issued executive orders for Federal agencies to assess what was needed to implement the CBDC system, so coming together 3-4 years later seems plausible."

Words only will be drowned, the messenger silenced, any insurrection quashed unless the ‚ÄúHeads‚Äù of the Movement are first removed.<br>But unknown to each other how can they join forces?

If the central banks and the governments they serve see that bank runs are starting, they will renege on those promises and either 1) electronically limit withdrawals; and/or 2) electronically block withdrawals completely (bank holidays) for periods of time. Those withdrawal restrictions will be much easier to impose electronically. Similarly, the central banks will find it much easier to selectively electronically inject extra liquidity into the banks that are under the greatest pressure. Those rapid, selective, and proportional counter-cyclical monetary measures are among the primary reasons most of the major central banks are gearing up their wholesale and retail CBDCs.

I think a bank run can easily be accelerated by influencers, and the banks should be concerned whether the information are accurate, or otherwise. The banks want to control the demolition, if it comes to that. The democratization of information (and disinformation) is a threat to those who use to monopolize the rules and levers of communication and dialogue."

Obviously it is not a run on digits in a computer or on paper that can be printed at will.  It is the conversion of digits into real assets that scares the banks.  Scares them because such bank runs expose the biggest crime in the history of this planet.  The multi decade theft of human value through fiat currency.

They new that industry and now the goose that laid the golden eggs which hatched into America&#39;s technological advantage in the global marketplace has been slaughtered by the institution created in 1913 to protect it from bank runs. Instead the Fed took down America&#39;s tech advantage and gave a big win to China. That is treason.

We often hear about the extent of Treasury debt holdings by China.  If you elect to raise interest rates in order to combat inflation it would seem logical to understand the risk to institutions holding these securities.  This is the second failure by the Federal Reserve in this business cycle.  They were asleep regarding the inflation consequences of pumping trillions of dollars into the economy while aggregate output flattened or shrunk.  Two important lessons of my undergraduate study of economics:<br><br>1.  You cannot put huge sums money in the hands of those who are producing no output without debasing the currency.<br>2.  When you are late to the party you drink too much, too fast.  The Fed has been imbibing excessively to cover its earlier mistakes and now others suffer the hangover.  <br><br>Like so many educational institutions, the Fed seems to be immune to its own knowledge."

Not at all the same as 2008 which was a time where large banks were the problem as they had far less capital constraints. Funny thought: in the US the least valued of the large bank is Citi as ROE is low... but just like EU banks it trades at a massive discount to tangible book... and yet out of all US large banks it is the safest due to the diversity of its income (products, geography, industries)... lower ROE simply because it is more boring, went from one extreme to the other after 2008"

The Fed is rate hiking so fast that the banks are building unrealized losses from treasury bonds at an alarming rate as bond values fall on the short end. Meanwhile long term bonds are locked in place until maturity. As people run to the banks those unrealized losses are becoming realized. Silicon Valley Bank was pretty conservative and safe with their loans. If they can go under all banks are in trouble.

Most in these industries network and share strategies. If this bank was doing things that made them insolvent, other banks were likely doing the same. While FDIC will return $250k in deposits to the individuals, companies had millions of dollars stored there. For most startups that will crunch their balance sheets. While this may not touch the largest banks,who knows, at minimum this will increase layoffs.

UCDVM_9PYVXgEGdkSLuUX6zg,@veskoslavchev4614,2023-03-11T10:29:21Z,The more interesting question is how come these banks did not do any proper stress testing and how long will the regulators take before rising the risk weights of crypto to above 100% which is the RW of regulatory capital investments. Some high risk exposures are assigned 150% under current Basel rules and is appropriate to seperate crypto from ordinary securities.

Any conventional bank gets in trouble, they get tens, if needed even hundreds of billions of dollars from the tax payers &quot;for the good of the people&quot; but no shits are given when a crypto bank falls, even though this has similar consequences, only because those are for people who acknowledge that fiat currency is becoming increasingly unstable and diversified their holdings.

I know you hate crypto and millenials living in the moms basements, but please keep to the truth.<br><br>Silvergate crashed because of good, old-fashioned greed. Silvergate had, as you said at #<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxcwn7xoXhU&amp;t=870"">14:30</a> invested a lot of their customers deposits in these hold-to-maturity bonds, these &quot;agency bonds&quot;: bonds that mature some 4-5 years into the future.<br><br>Investopedia (which I choose to trust on this matter - your mileage may wary) describes these agency bonds as follows:<br><br>- &quot;An agency bond is a security issued by a government-sponsored enterprise or by a federal government department other than the U.S. Treasury. Some are not fully guaranteed in the same way that U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds are.<br>[...]<br>Treasury bonds are attractive to investors because of their safety, liquidity, and state tax- exempt interest. Agency bonds are attractive to investors because of the safety, liquidity, higher yields relative to Treasuries, and for some agencies, their state tax-exempt interest.&quot;<br><br>The problem with these hold-to-maturity bonds is that when Silvergate bought them at &quot;fair value&quot; just a few years or months ago, the US interest rate was much lower than today. And bond values correlates inverse to interest rate, so now with the current and continuing FED raises of interests, the value of these fixed interest bonds goes down.<br><br>Now, as all of us &quot;knows&quot; you really haven&#39;t lost money in the stock market until you sell your bad performing stonks. Same with Silvergate. On their accounting books, these agency bonds was reported and valued at their original price, not their new fair value taking the current interest rate into account. It was only when Silvergate customers started to withdraw deposits and Silvergate needed good old fashioned fiat US Dollars to keep up with the withdrawals, the problem with the original fair value not being fair any longer became a problem. The agency bonds, held until maturity, which paid out (guessing here 2 % in interests) was simply worth a lot less when newly issued federal bonds promised 3-4 % interest with a lot shorter life span and shorter risk. So Silvergate, which had been too greedy when investing in these agency bonds, was forced to sell and realise a significant loss in the billions of US Dollars range. That was what brought down Silvergate. It was greed not &quot;crypto-related events&quot;."

If they have $50 million in deposits and give a $10 million loan, they‚Äôre not taking the equivalent of $10 million out of everybody else‚Äôs savings, they are creating credit and a promissory note is issued. They are credit creators, not intermediaries, this is where so much stuff to do with banking goes wrong. They don‚Äôt lend money they have on the books, they create a credit out of thin air and make their money back on interest, which is also why is a source of inflation over time. And is why there is more credit in the system and actual hard-currency. This wouldn‚Äôt be the case in a system where banks are just intermediaries because every dollar would have a corresponding dollar. That‚Äôs not what we have."

The amount of deposits in that bank hold by ‚Äústart ups‚Äú in excess of the insured amount was effing absurd. There is no excuse for a treasury manager assuming you actually are smart enough to have one, to keep any amount in a bank (certainly not a major money center bank) greater than something near the FDIC limit when you can transfer it to treasury bills by the day, or if you‚Äôre really lazy, just simply open up a CDARS account, which gives you multiple $250,000‚Äôs worth of FDIC insurance. Or if you need it in DDA cash you can use the equivalent of CDARS, ICS. But, of course, to even think about that you would have to first realize you‚Äôre not a master of the universe. And I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyone in Silicon Valley who has the humility to possibly think that. I hope you all lose your asses."

If they want to remain viable while taking on big chunks of novel, synthetic, potentially illiquid, and mismatched liabilities they need to get in the game of managing for the unthinkable - in a big bank the trading desks or RM would be running sensitivity analysis on FFR rises right from the first JPow announcement - what would happen if rates rose 25-50-75bp-quarterly out to a 5% terminal rate, or 6% etc, or the Full Volcker. The desk would then have scenarios to hedge against, mainly interest rate swaps, which could also blow up but at least they have the capacity to engage in relatively sophisticated hedging. Smaller banks, no matter what their asset base looks like, if they&#39;re small they have a narrow and shallow pool of expertise and experience to run a difficult - but necessary - irs swaps program. In a very real sense complexity and market structure favor the big banks and funds, and small banks end up being the first penguin to toddle off the ice shelf, eaten by the hungriest seal waiting below."
UCRYY-AZLDRIRxG7ts-Y8bLQ,@johnbailey3351,2023-03-10T22:31:20Z,"Bank runs!  During the GFC, I worked at a small community bank.  In early-to-mid 2008, depositors that exceeded the FDIC limit, started to take their excess funds out of one local bank and put it into one or more other local banks.  They often had to wait for their CDs to mature.  The only thing this did was to keep those who opened new accounts VERY busy.  By mid-to-late 2008, things changed and people wanted to take cash home.  I was a lender, but I got up to five calls per day from customers wanted to get their hands on $5k to $50k and I would help as best I could.  Finally the FDIC raised the insurance limit and everything calmed down pretty quickly.  The problem with SVB was that 90% of its deposits were uninsured meaning that the average depositor at SVB had $2,500,000 on deposit, hence $250k insured and $2.25 million uninsured.  I predict a lot banks with large depositors will drop the interest paid on large accounts downward, while brokering CDs to smaller depositors.  It will hurt their net interest margin and profits, but will reduce the impact of bank runs.  That or the FDIC and/or Fed will &quot;do something&quot;. What I have no idea, but the quicker the better."

I understand that there are programs to protect customers of the regular banks, but how bad could he get for banks in the US in this high interest rate high inflation environment? thank you!"

There is pressure to issue an unqualified/clean opinion. Especially when you go for a budget firm.

I don&#39;t mind audits but it must&#39;ve been <b>really</b> bad if they broke off an audit engagement for their procedures being too rigorous.

Higher i-rate shifts both demand curves and supply curves to the left, double reducing consumer goods sales and not necessarily lowering prices and in fact probably increasing them.  In deflationary depression firms &quot;stagflate&quot; prices, raising costs more and more in response to fewer buyers in order to cover fixed costs of rent and interest and increased prices from likewise-responding input suppliers."

Is there a systemic risk here?

It would have been nice to spend more time talking about the situation with SVB because it has wider implications and could be applicable to many other banks. The unrealized bank losses on bonds, currently standing at about $700 billion, are a financial nuclear bomb that can blow up the entire banking system, as people start moving their money from non-interest bearing current accounts to CDs and other safe interest bearing instruments returning 4-5%."

UCohAY4ilO19vv8SAwBKfvKg,@Jim-Tuner,2023-03-10T21:07:05Z,"1) After 2008, the fed demands that the banks increase their safe reserves.<br>2) The banks respond by creating new big portfolios of ultra-safe assets. Namely long-term US treasury bonds.<br>3) Nobody at the fed or the banks thinks at all about the impact of interest rates on those portfolios. Or the impact on actual bank liquidity with rising interest rates.<br>4) So now we have suddenly realized today that the &quot;safe&quot; long-term assets that represent reserves are incredibly ill-liquid in the face of rising interest rates and were never as safe as they seemed.<br><br>Big things have small beginnings. The last time all this happened was in the 1980s. It happened with mortgages and savings &amp; loans in an environment of rising interest rates."

In the next days, the banking crisis would have to be epic and gigantic for the FED to decide not to raise interest rates. This won&#39;t happen; an increase and a crash are coming. There will be more negative portfolios this 2nd half of 2023 with markets tumbling, soaring inflation, and banks going out of business. My concern is how can the rapid interest-rate hike be of favor to a value investor, or is it better avoiding stocks for a while?"

UCqDpyTaukpOxB4E-yFyBmcg,@NITHerBest,2023-09-12T14:29:37Z,"Some banks are too big to fail, and they will be rescued no matter what. This is because if the total banking system fails, the economy crashes 100%, and the politicians will not let that happen. If you have a deposit OVER the insured limit per bank, then I would diversify into many large banks, and not least trasury bonds with short maturity. If interes rates go up, you get an unrealized loss, but if you sit to maturity you get the deposit + interest, but if rates go DOWN, you get an unrealized gain, which you can realize selling the bond in the market. The odds are big that the FED will have to decrease the short term FED rates if /when we get a financial crisis, to restart the economy. Win win. After it all crashes, including gold and silver, buy gold stocks (not before then). Perhaps some bitcoin also, that also will crash when &quot;the everyhing bubble&quot; crashes."

Specially in the high interest rate environment. <br><br>Think of it this way. The currency has always go to the bank. If u pull out of the bank. U will pull out of bank A and put it in bank B or C. Even if the rich guys pull out of a bank X, they will eventually be putting it in bank Y or Z. So on an overall basis, the deposits in bank A goes down but the deposits in bank B and C go up. Because the currency has to go somewhere. U won&#39;t put it under the matrice. <br><br>In another scenarios. It can mean that the currency is being pulled out of country X and the deposits in the banks in country Y are going up. That would be capital flight. And a more likely scenario. <br><br>The last possibility is that the central bank is pulling the liquidity out. I.e. shrinking the currency supply. So a bank deposit decrease has to be seen with deflation in the currency supply in that country."
